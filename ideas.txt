SYSTEM DESIGN CONCEPTS

    GPT as the Planner: Use GPT-4o to handle all planning, architecture, debugging, tool generation, and adaptation. Never rely on the user for technical skill.

    Local LLMs as Executors: Offload tool calls, memory searches, file writes, and summaries to small, fast, local models.

    User-Goal Driven: Let the user state goals in natural language. GPT plans the solution and orchestrates execution through local components.

üîå TOOL DESIGN AND INTERFACE

    Schema-Validated Tool Calls: All tools must be invoked using strict ToolCallSpec structures (name, arguments) to prevent errors and misuse.

    Descriptive Tool Naming: Use names like extract_logs() instead of tool_17 to reduce the need for explanations in prompts.

    Expandable Tool Prompts: Inject only tool names/syntax into GPT's prompt. Let GPT ask for full details (describe_tool()) if needed.

    Token-Efficient Tool Manifest: Design prompt injection to minimize token cost by tiering tool metadata.

üíæ MEMORY STRATEGY

    Structured Long-Term Memory: Use PostgreSQL + pgvector to store GPT-facing memory with metadata (certainty, tags, timestamps, importance).

    Semantic Short-Term Recall: Use FAISS or local LLM vector memory for active task recall and fast fuzzy lookup.

    Summarized Prompts Only: Don‚Äôt inject raw logs or memory into GPT‚Äîsummarize via local LLM first.

    Memory Filtering by Request: Let GPT ask for specific memory types or tags rather than loading everything every round.

üí¨ TOKEN OPTIMIZATION & EFFICIENCY

    No Hard Limit, Just Control: Don‚Äôt cap token input, but always justify input token cost.

    Tiered Prompt Structure:

        Inject tool list

        Inject current goal + last result

        Add memory summary only if flagged

    Let GPT Request Context: Build GPT prompts to assume "just enough context," and let it explicitly ask for more.

üîÅ GPT EXECUTION LOOP

    Step-Based Planning: GPT creates one or more steps per goal, submits to a loop.

    ExecutionResult Reporting: Local LLM returns status, memory updates, and logs via schema.

    Loop Until Completion or Manual Stop: GPT decides when a goal is done or needs escalation.

üîê SAFETY, RELIABILITY, AND CONTROL

    All Code Verified: GPT must confirm code changes with {"status":"ok"} or rerun/refactor.

    Sandbox User Interaction: Let the user see and control the system‚Äîbut never give write access to system code or shell.

    Controlled File Writes: All changes go through a write_file(path, content) interface with logging.

    Recovery Engine: If a component breaks, GPT can use its own build logs or prompt to regenerate it safely.
