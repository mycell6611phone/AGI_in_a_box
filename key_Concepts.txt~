Extracted Key Concepts (Last 10 Messages)
1. System Role Separation

    GPT is the strategic brain: plans, verifies, evolves

    Local LLMs are execution agents: cut/paste, summarize, run tool calls

    You are the idea generator and overseer, not a coder

2. Prompt Efficiency Model

    Do not hard-limit GPT input, but control prompt size via:

        Descriptive tool names

        Injecting only tool names/syntax

        Letting GPT request full tool detail if needed

    Option to use local LLM agent to serve expanded tool help, memory, or logs only when GPT asks

3. Self-Recovery Scope

    GPT doesn’t need full AGI-style autonomy

    “Self-repair” = GPT restoring broken modules using its own previous logic

    Mirrors human learning: "it remembers how to fix what it’s already fixed"

4. Memory Strategy

    GPT's memory = structured, long-term (Postgres + pgvector)

    Local LLM memory = session-limited, doc chunking, label-based search

    Only inject top-3 memory summaries or goal state unless GPT explicitly requests more

5. Token Cost Management

    Everything fed to GPT must earn its token cost

    Design system to keep total GPT prompt input under ~2–4K unless explicitly expanded

    Summarization, tagging, and compression handled by local LLM

6. Tool Use Philosophy

    GPT should be reminded of tools every loop, but not fed full detail

    Tools should have names that are self-explanatory (e.g., restart_service(name))

    GPT can request describe_tool("X") if it needs more info

    Tool manifest is tiered: names → syntax → description (on demand)

7. System Trust Model

    You don’t need protection—you need reliability

    GPT should sandbox you from breaking the system, not hide it from you

    Everything must be loggable, visible, and reversible, but hardened against accidental deletion or corruption

8. Productization Plan

    You will source hardware

    Assemble and ship complete AI boxes with OSIRIS pre-installed

    Provide support, upgrades, and expansion modules

    Goal: mutual profit for OpenAI, you, hardware vendors, and customers
